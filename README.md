# chunkify

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yangmillstheory/chunkify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yangmillstheory/chunkify)

An [ES6-developed](http://babeljs.io/) functional API that prevents long-running scripts from blocking the JavaScript thread.

## Install

    $ npm install --save chunkify
    
## Usage

Import the module:

    import chunkify from 'chunkify'
    
## <a name='options'>Options

In [API methods](#api), an optional `options` object may provide any subset of the following data:

* `chunk`: the number of items in `array` to successively invoke `fn` on before yielding control of the main thread. 
    * default value is `1`
    * must be positive
    * aliases: `chunksize`
* `delay`: the minimal time in milliseconds to wait before continuing to invoke `fn` on `array`. 
    * default value is `0`
    * must be non-negative
    * aliases: `yield`, `yieldtime`, `delaytime`
* `scope`: the object on which the processing function `fn` is invoked on.  
    * default value is `null`
    * must not be a `Number`, `Boolean`, or `undefined`

## <a name='api'>API

### <a name='each'>chunkify.each(Array array, Function fn, [Object options])</a>

`fn` is invoked on successive `array` elements and their indices (`fn(item, index)`). At every `chunk`<sup>th</sup> invocation, control is yielded back to the thread. After (at least) `delay` milliseconds, `fn` picks up where it left off. This continues until all items in `array` have been processed by `fn`. 
   
Returns a `Promise` that resolves with `undefined` when `fn` has been invoked on all items in `array`.

### chunkify.map(Array array, Function fn, [Object options])
 
Identical to [chunkify.each](#each), except the returned `Promise` resolves with the `array` mapped by `fn`.

### chunkify.reduce(Array array, Function fn, [Object options])
 
Exactly the [native reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) on `Arrays`, but the work is chunked up as [above](#each), and the returned promise resolves with the result of the reduction.

**In any of the examples above, if any invocation of `fn` throws an `Error`, the promise is rejected with an object `{error, item, index}`, where `error` is the caught `Error`, `index` is the index in `array` where the invocation threw, and `item` is `array[index]`. No further processing happens after the failure.**

## Future Plans

Expose a [generator-friendly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) API.
